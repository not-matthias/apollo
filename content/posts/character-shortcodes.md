Did you know that The oldest programming language still in use is FORTRAN which was created in 1957 by John Backus? 

{{ character(name="hooded", body="Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat, that's almost 70 years ago???") }}

I know, it's crazy. Here's an example program:

```
PROGRAM MAIN
PRINT *, 'HELLO WORLD'
STOP
END
```

{% character(name="hooded") %}
There's also a more modern version which is a bit easier to read:
```
program helloWorld
   print *, "Hello World!"
end program helloWorld
```
{% end %}

Good to know, thanks buddy!

{{ character(body=":)", position="left") }}
